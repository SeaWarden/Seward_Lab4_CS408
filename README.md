# bird-watching-website (lab4)

This project is meant to give us hands on experience implementing CSS to an existing html structure. This all mainly serves as a brush-up from the CS 208 course.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and navigate to the location of the repo (on Windows, this can be done by using File Explorer). Access the 'assets' folder within* and find the file 'index.html'.

Run the html file, which should show the website on your default browser.

*It should be noted, there are technically two 'assets' folders. Choose the superficial one (not the one imbedded within _MACOSX).

If any changes are made to the files, the browser will need to be refreshed in order to see those changes.
